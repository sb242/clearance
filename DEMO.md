Tagline:
Clearance is an app designed to provide accurate and up-to-date medication, allergy, and medical history information prior to an appointment with your allied health professional. 

The problem: 
A patient might have a family Dr, a Rheumatologist, a Cardiologist, and a Dermatologist prescribing different medications and treating your ailments. Unfortunately the patient can never remember names/dosages or ever why they might be taking these medications. Which can hinder appointments with allied health professionals in terms of profit loss, and rescheduling. 

The scenario:
A patient arrives for an appointment with their optometrist, or their massage therapist, or their dental hygienist. Before these allied health professionals can proceed with treating you they require full disclosure of your most recent medical information.

"Hi Chris, has anything changed with your medical history? I have one medication on file for high blood pressure, which is Metoprolol and you're taking 100mg 1x a day, is that correct?"

"No, I'm taking another pill now, it's a white one, I think it starts with an 'R' but I don't remember why I'm taking it"

"Unfortunately we can't proceed with treatment today until I have medical CLEARANCE and understand what new medication you're taking"

The solution:
With CLEARANCE our aim is to bridge the gap between prescribing Drs and other medical health professionals so that all those involved in your medical wellness are on the same page. 

## Main features 120-150 seconds

Walk-through:
- Add a new medication

- Edit an existing medical condition

- Delete an allergy 

- Add a contact (so we can email pdf)

- generate pdf for download

- email pdf to new contact
Emphasize, our goal is for allied health professionals to request the patients most current information 48 hours in advance, in coordination with the appointment confirmation. 

Why is this important?
The allied health professional can now see that since the patient Rachel Jones last visited us they have had coronary stent surgery, we can now alert Rachel that they must take antibiotics 1 hour prior to any dental treatment for the next 2 years to prevent infective endocarditis. 

We just saved the patient having to show up for an appointment and leave disappointed that they won't be treated. We also just saved the provider hundreds of dollars in lost production.
